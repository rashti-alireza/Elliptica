#    NOTE1: There are different calculation parts, in each part use 
# different names for new variables.
#
#    NOTE2: In Schur domain decomposition method we need two types of
# matrices for Jacobian of Newton-Raphson scheme, matrix B and matrix E. 
# Let's say Jx = -F in Newton-Raphson scheme; then,
# B[i][j] = d[F(f(ijk))]/df(lmn), ijk takes their values ON INNER POINTS
# of a patch, namley those collocated points that don't reach boundary of
# the patch, and lmn runs over ALL BUT the interface points (interface
# points are those located between two patches).
# E[i][j] = d[F(f(ijk))]/df(lmn), ijk takes their values ON INTERFACE
# POINTS, namely those collocated points ON the boundary between two
# patches, lmn runs over ALL BUT the interface points.
#
#    PRAGMATICALLY:
# Fill both B matrix and E matrix part WITH THE SAME EQUATION, you just
# need to write two duplicated equations for each part, 
# and if you're using interim variables use different names for each part.
#
#    NOTE3: For each part which doesn't exist, let it be 0.
