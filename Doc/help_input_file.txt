In the following one can find list of all parameters and some rules:

Rules:
o. Character '#' comments out from 
    where it has been put to the the end of line.
o. all in beginning of a parameters means it is a shared value.


Parameters: different values written in {here} and comments marked by #

o. For projects:
    Project = {Laplace_Inhom} #executing project

o. For output folder:
    output_directory_name = {default} # one can put any name

o. For patch and grid and related:
    grid_kind = {Cartesian_grid} #type of grid
    number_of_boxes = 2 # for example
    all_basis = {Chebyshev_first_kind,no_basis} # 
    all_collocation = {Chebyshev_zero,EquiSpaced}
    all_Nabc = ? # number of point in each direction

    box?_center_a = 2 # center of box? in direction a
    box?_center_b = 0 # center of box? in direction b
    box?_center_c = -2 # center of box? in direction c
    box?_size_a = 4; # length of a
    box?_size_b = 4; # length of b
    box?_size_c = 4; # length of c
    box?_n_a = 30; # number of point in direction a
    box?_n_b = 30; # number of point in direction b
    box?_n_c = 30; # number of point in direction c
    box?_collocation = {Chebyshev_zero,EquiSpaced}
    box?_basis = {Chebyshev_first_kind,no_basis}

o. For printing:
#if one doesn't write each of them, it means no.
    print_parameter = {yes,no}
    print_coords = {yes,no}#prints nodes in Cartesian coords
    print_interfaces = {yes,no}#prints interfaces between patches
