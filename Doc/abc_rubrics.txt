Some rubrics which should be met during the coding and organizing:

1. The First letter of folder is capital
2. All files are written in small letters, unless their names have to.
3. tab should be 2 space i.e. /b/b = /t
4. comments and explanations in the codes may be written in small letters
and should be used by /* comments come here */ not // since the last
one is not compatible with ANSI.
5. const keyword: always use const keyword whenever is possible.
(generally speaking the criteria is improving the readability and performance 
and avoiding potential errors)
6. use always unsigned for counting of objects and allocation of memory.
7. all functions of a project which are not static must be named like
	NameOfTheProject_task; for example:
	TOV_solution() or TOV_free().
8. all functions of a module which are not static must be named like
        task_NameOfTheModule; for example:
        free_EoS().
